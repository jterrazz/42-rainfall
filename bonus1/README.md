```

## Steps
We can see a call to `/bin/sh` but some conditional jumps prevent its execution.   
If after passing it to `atoi()` the first argument is superior or equal to 9, the process will exit.   
Otherwise it will use that `number * 4` as a size parameter to `memcpy()` `argv[2]` into a buffer.   

The last conditional jump compares a dword value placed 40 bytes after the start of the buffer.    
This means we need the `memcpy()` size to reach at least `44 bytes` in length.

The `jle` instruction treats the input as signed, this means we can enter a negative signed integer that will equate `44` after being multiplied by `4`.

```bash
./bonus1 -1073741813 $(python -c "print 'A' * 40 + 'FLOW")

cat /home/user/bonus2/.pass
